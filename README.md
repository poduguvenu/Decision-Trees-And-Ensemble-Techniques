# Decision-Trees-And-Ensemble-Techniques
1. Decision Tree Classification - Using Cost Complexity Pruning
2. Decision Tree - Post Pruning
3. Hyperparameter Optimization for Random Forest Classification using RandomizedSearchCV
  Here we are going to have a detailed explanation of RandomizedSearchCV and how we can use it to select the best hyperparameter.
