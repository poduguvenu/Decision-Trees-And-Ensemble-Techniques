# Decision-Trees-And-Ensemble-Techniques
1. Decision Tree Classification - Using Cost Complexity Pruning
2. Decision Tree - Post Pruning
3. Hyperparameter Optimization for Random Forest Classification using RandomizedSearchCV

  Here we are going to have a detailed explanation of RandomizedSearchCV and how we can use it to select the best hyperparameter.
4. Various Hyperparameter Optimization Techniques
5. Decision Tree Classifier
    Python implementation of Decision Tree Classifier with out using any built-in libraries
